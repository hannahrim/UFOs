# UFOs
  In this assignment I created an interactive webpage where users can parse data around UFO sightings. I created a webpage to view the data with HTML, deployed JavaScript functions to create a table and its filters, and customized the webpage with CSS. 
  
A recommendation for further development would be to filter the other columns such as adding time into the filtered data. We could determine if there is a pattern regarding which time of day UFOs tend to appear. Also, more user friendly input fields could be built, such as drop down boxes.
